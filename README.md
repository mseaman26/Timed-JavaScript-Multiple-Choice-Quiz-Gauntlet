# Timed-JavaScript-Multiple-Choice-Quiz-Gauntlet
This program takes the user through a multiple-choice quiz on the topic of JavaScript.  The quiz not only features questions, but also a timer, making the quiz more pressure-inducing. Wrong answers are extra punishing because not only do they lower the user's percentage, but they take time off the timer as well!  To make things more intense, the time remaining at the end is factored in by being multiplied by the percentage that the user scored on the questions.  After the quiz.  The user submits their name and their score is logged on the scoreboard for all to see
